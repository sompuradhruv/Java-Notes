encapsulation is basically declaring the variables as private so that the only way to access them is through getters and setters or through other public functions
basically private variables and public fnctions. public functions me parameter to be passed has different variable name than instance(private wala) variable

eg.

package com.timbuchalka;

/**
 * Created by dev on 31/07/15.
 */
public class EnhancedPlayer {
    private String name;
    private int hitPoints = 100;
    private String weapon;

    public EnhancedPlayer(String name, int health, String weapon) {
        this.name = name;

        if(health >0 && health <= 100) {
            this.hitPoints = health;
        }

        this.weapon = weapon;
    }

    public void loseHealth(int damage) {
        this.hitPoints = this.hitPoints - damage;
        if(this.hitPoints <=0) {
            System.out.println("Player knocked out");
            // Reduce number of lives remaining for the player
        }
    }

    public int getHealth() {
        return hitPoints;
    }
}

package com.timbuchalka;

public class Main {
        EnhancedPlayer player = new EnhancedPlayer("Tim", 200, "Sword");
        player.loseHealth(10);
        System.out.println("Initial health is " + player.getHealth());
    }
}
