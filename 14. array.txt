array declaration-
int[] arr= new int[10];

array is a refrence type which means
int[] arr={1,2,3,4,5};
int[] arr2=arr;
arr2[0]=10;
//now arr2 becomes 10,2,3,4,5
//and arr will also become the same
//that is arr=10,2,3,4,5
//it means arr2 ke changes are refelcted in arr
//this is beacuse array is refrence type
//like objects both arr and arr2 point to the same place in memory
//changes in arr are reflected in arr2
//changes in arr2 are reflected in arr
int[] arr3=arr;
arr3=new int[] {1,2,3,4,5};
//as we added new int statement now arr3 points to a new different location so changes in arr3 will not be reflected in arr or arr2
